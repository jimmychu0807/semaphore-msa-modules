## Overview

This project mainly consists of [a validator and an executor modules](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579#validators) adheres to [**ERC-7579**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579) standard that uses [Semaphore](https://semaphore.pse.dev/) for proof validation. Smart accounts incorporate these modules gain the following benefits:

- The smart account behaves like an  **anonymous multi-sig wallet** controlled by [Semaphore group members](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/guides/groups) of the smart account. Proofs sent by the members are regarded as signatures.

- The smart account gains Semaphore property guaranteeing a valid proof (seen as signature) must be from a member within the group and have not signed before, while preserving the member privacy and no one could trace who send the proof from the on-chain log.

Development of this project is supported by [PSE Acceleration Program](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program) (see [thread discussion](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/72)).
